# FoliFF-JS-Pokemon-App
This project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop a simple app that loads and presents data from an external API, in this case pokemon. The user is able to select specific data for detailed viewing. Additionally, the app has a navigator to direct the user to external websites with official and fan-created content related to the API. In other words we are creating a pokedex to view on the web.
